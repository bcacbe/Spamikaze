This document is just a small setup to identify the actions
spamikaze needs. It should lead to an API we can use to
develop next versions.


Actions can be devided into 4 main categories:

1. Add/update/delete entries.
2. Lookup information from the database/config files.
3. Parse lists that can be used by third party programs/humans.
   (This is partly mixed with category 2.
4. Common code to handle stuff that is not mentioned in 1..3


1a. Add entries.
----------------

   1. ipnumbers.
   2. ipranges.
   3. fqdn.
   4. hostnames?
   5. abuse addresses.
   6. ...


1b. Update entries.
-------------------

   1. alter abuse adresses.
   2. ....

1c. Delete entries.
-------------------

   1. expire ipnumbers.
   2. delete ipnumbers where abusedesks act on complaints.
   3. .....
   

2a. Lookup entries from the database/config
-------------------------------------------

   1. is an ipnumber listed.
   2. is a range listed.
   3. is an abuse address listed for an ip or a range.
   4. is an ip address whitelisted.
   5. how many entries are listed for an ip address.
   6. how many ip addresses are listed for a range.
   ......
   10. fetch the config for the db server.
   .....

3. Parse lists/zone files.

   ..................


4. Other stuff...



----------------------
Other stuff to discuss
----------------------

1. Naming convention.

Anyone got a good suggestion? I'm not having a specific preference. As long
as it's readable.

2. Database layers.

Every api instance should handle one database engine. We all know that both
MySQL and PostgreSQL have their own particular tweaks to handle data the best
way, it would be good if we could use it all.

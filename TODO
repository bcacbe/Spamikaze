	TODO items for spamikaze


Before next release:
  * review the documentation for completeness and skip some of the older
    parts where users need to include the correct path.
  * test the current cvs tree on different machines.
  * make sure database handlers are closed to make sure it will not 
    barf out rollbacks (older perl versions).

For later versions:
  * Add whitelist mailserver table
  * Add whitelist zone file so more then one mailservers can use it
    within a company/org.
  * Add evidence table
  * the perl scripts in cgi-bin should be able to do the same as there 
    php ones.
  * sharing IP addresses with multiple spamikaze lists
  * recognise mailing list and mailer daemon messages, do not
    lists hosts sending those
  * (maybe) automatic escalation to netblocks if a lot of spam
    is received from netblocks
  * teach named.pl to use nsupdate so nameservers can resync
    using IXFR instead of AXFR
	* getcountries.pl
	* statscountry.pl
	* stop using system()

Wishlist:
* Templating for the webinterface

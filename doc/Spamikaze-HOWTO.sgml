<p>We are assuming you already have the required software installed
and running. If not then please get a version for your OS and install
it with the guidelines of that package.

<sect1><heading>MySQL</heading>

<p>Creating a new database for spamikaze. At the prompt you can use
mysqladmin to create a new database.

<verb>
    mysqladmin -u root -p create spamikaze
</verb>

<p>You will be prompted for the mysql root password, enter it. If no
errors are shown you need to login as mysql root to the database
server in order to grant privileges to the new spamikaze directory:

<verb>
    mysql -u root -p mysql
</verb>

<p>Again you will be prompted for a password, enter it.

<p>Once you are in you should grant privileges with to a user at either
localhost or a webserver able to access this mysql server. It is not
recommended to use a remote server without using some sort of encryption.
The following example will use user spamikaze at localhost. You need to
grant select, insert and update privileges at least. It is recommended
to hold back any other privileges at this time:

<verb>
mysql> GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON spamikaze.* TO
        spamikaze@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 's0m3leetpassw0rd';
</verb>

<p>Once this is done you only need to flush the privileges:

<verb>
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
</verb>

<p>The last thing to do with mysql is read the spamikaze-sf.sql into the newly
created database.

<verb>
    mysql -u root -p spamikaze < /path/spamikaze-sf.sql
</verb>

<p>Again you will be prompted for a password, enter it.

<sect1><heading>Postgresql</heading>

<p>Creating a new database for spamikaze. At the prompt you can use
createdb or pgsql to create a new database.

<verb>
   createdb spamikaze
</verb>

<p>The last thing to do with mysql is read the spamikaze-sf.sql into the newly
created database.

<verb>
    psql -h localhost -f /path/spamikaze-pg.sql spamikaze
</verb>
